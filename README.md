## golang

#### Just some notes as I go along

I still cannot stand the capital letters for visibilty. Why not just use the convention `_name` was private. Seems like such an odd take.

Why is there no functional like methods on slices. Even good old java and php have those now...

## solidjs

#### First impression so far

It seems lighter and more "normal" than react/next.js.

## tailwinds

I know the class names are fine but dang there is a lot.
